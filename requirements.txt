# Core dependencies (required)
# Tkinter is included with Python standard library

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features
# Sound effects - the game will work without these
pygame>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.20.0

# Note: If you don't want sound effects, you can install with:
# pip install --no-deps cryptic-crossings
# The game will automatically detect their absence and run silently
